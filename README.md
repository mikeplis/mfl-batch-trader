The goal of this script is to allow owners of a fantasy football team on MyFantasyLeague (MFL) to send similar offers to all other owners in their league. My original motivation for writing this script was to easily be able to offer a player to all other owners in my leagues in exchange for a future draft pick in a particular year and round. I have other ideas of ways to expand this, but right now, I'm just focusing on my original goal.
